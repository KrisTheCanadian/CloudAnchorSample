# ARCore Cloud Anchor Sample for Unity

This is the working version of ARCore Cloud Anchor Sample for Unity. Official documentation is a bit lacking, so I assembled working versions of nessesary packages. More details can be found at [Medium article](https://medium.com/@luchianno/how-to-build-arcore-cloud-anchor-sample-for-unity-c2c4e8046f84?source=friends_link&sk=e7d292f2a698e48c5e437fc45de197a4). 

### Usage

After cloning the repository, you'll have to obtain Google Cloud API key and paste it into _**Cloud Anchor API Keys**_ at _**Edit>Project Settings>XR>ARCore Extensions**_
